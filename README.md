# data-from-Perié-L-Cell-report-2014
Data used in the paper Perié L, Cell report 2014 doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2014.01.016.

The data are initially from the paper Naik S, Nature 2013 doi: 10.1038/nature12013
LMPP progenitors have been labelled with cellular barcoding and their progeny collected at day 14 post-transplantation. The data are coming from 4 mice. 
These data have been binarized and categorized as described in the paper for the purpose of the modeling. 

There is a typo in the original paper and in the supplementary material. The equation giving pMDB-M should be alphaB*alphaD/ (sum(alphas) "*" instead of a "+"
